# Solutions to Advent of Code 2022

I will try to provide solutions in both python and rust. 
The plan is to no require any third-part dependencies (but no promises are made).

- Python version: 3.10.6 
- rustc 1.64.0

To run the python code do
```
cd dayXX
python main.py
```
To run the rust version do
```
cd dayXX
cargo run
```
